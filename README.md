This Project clears the Model Cache when disconnecting from a server, only the main branch of Gmod is supported.  
It also activates Async Load for some DataTypes. (`MDLCACHE_STUDIOHWDATA`, `MDLCACHE_VCOLLIDE` and `MDLCACHE_VERTEXES`)

Note: This Project usesÂ [Garry's Mod Common](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common)

## Current Status
Bugs:  
- Content from Addons also get unloaded.
- Playermodel sometimes break

What I'm currently working on:  
- Cleaning up the entire code
- providing some functions to the menu state and client state.
- Better Cache handling
  - Try to only unload Map content first
  - Try to only unload Content downloaded by the Server.
  - Try not to unload Content from Addons
  - Add some type of tag that allows a server to stop the cache / tell the cache to not unload Content.

## How to Install
1. You need to download the `gmsv_cache_win32.dll` from the latest [release](https://github.com/RaphaelIT7/gmod-clearcache/releases)  
2. Move the `gmsv_cache_win32.dll` into your `garrysmod/lua/bin` folder.
3. You need insert

Windows:
```lua
if file.Exists("lua/bin/gmsv_cache_win32.dll", "GAME") then
  require("cache")
end
```

Linux:
```lua
if file.Exists("lua/bin/gmsv_cache_linux.dll", "GAME") then
  require("cache")
end
```

Into the `garrysmod/lua/menu/menu.lua` file at the bottom.

Note: If you change your Gmod branch or an update is made, your changes could get removed.

## How it currently works.
You can use the `cache_flush` command to manually flush the cache if it somehow didn't flush it itself, or if you just want to clear the cache completely.   
This command only works when you're not connected to a Server!  
NOTE: This command will flush some data that is not cleared automatically like `MDLCACHE_FLUSH_STUDIOHDR` or `MDLCACHE_FLUSH_VCOLLIDE` data because flushing them while joining a Server can cause some unexpected crashes or bugs like some Models having no collisions.  
(If you want to know what exactly crashes, `vphysics.dll` and `datacache.dll` are the ones crashing)
